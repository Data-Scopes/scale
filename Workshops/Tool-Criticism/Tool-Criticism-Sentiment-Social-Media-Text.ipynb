    "## Sentiment Analysis for Social Media Texts\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides some insights in how sentiment analysis struggles with different types of texts, and points to some potential pitfalls and things to take into account, to develop intuitions for when and how to use it, and what questions to ask yourself when incorporating it in your research processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We look at in two types of social media texts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Amazon book reviews**: Two sets of 10,000 reviews each (taken from the excellent [Amazon Review Data](https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html) site). We are interested in comparing sets of books reviews to get insight into how books affect readers and how, for instance, the introduction of a TV or Film adaptation influences this.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tweets**: a rather arbitrary set of very old tweets, taken from a much larger [collection of tweets available on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140).\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with a set of user reviews of the book *The Handmaid's Tale* by Margaret Atwood. The dataset consists of 10,000 Amazon user reviews. \n",
    "\n",
    "The sentiment analysis tool we use is [VADER](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment), which is incorporated in [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "These round numbers of reviews should trigger alarm bells that this is probably a selection from a larger set reviews, but is capped at 10,000 for convenience. What do you need to know about the selection process to understand what this dataset represents and what its limitations are?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the intended use of the VADER sentiment analyser? For what kind of data is it made to work well? Got to the [VADER](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment) website and see what you can find out about its strengths and limitations. "
