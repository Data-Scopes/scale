# Data Directory

This directory is used by the notebooks for loading datasets. We don't include the datasets in the Github repository for easons of space and ethics. Below we list the original dataset and where you can download them:

### Datasets

The notebooks use two datasets, one of correspondences of historical figures, and one of online book reviews. 

The correspondence dataset contains metadata for around 110,000 letters from the [Early Modern Letters Online (EMLO)](http://emlo.bodleian.ox.ac.uk) project. The metadata consists of sending date, sender, receiver, location of sender and location of receiver.

The online review dataset contains review text and metadata for [15 million book reviews from Goodreads](https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/ucsdbookgraph/home) and [51 million book reviews from Amazon](https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html). The metadata consists of review author, review date, rating, reviewed book and author and the platform on which it was published (i.e. Amazon or Goodreads).
